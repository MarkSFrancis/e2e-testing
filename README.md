# Angular E2E Testing
A learning exercise for me, finding out how to creating E2E and unit tests in Angular

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm start`

1. Open your browser at `http://localhost:4200`

**Optional**:
<br/>
On subsequent runs, you can use `npm run startfast` which skips the package installation step

## Running Tests

#### Unit tests
Run `npm test`. This runs as a watcher in the background, and so you can continue developing whilst this runs, and it will re-run all tests as you change your code

#### End to end tests
Run `npm run e2e`. This runs as a 1 time process, and must be re-run each time you want to run all the end to end tests
